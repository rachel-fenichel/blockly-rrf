# Blockly Developer Tools

[Blockly Developer
Tools](https://raspberrypifoundation.github.io/blockly-samples/examples/developer-tools/index.html)
is a web-based developer tool that can help you build
[custom blocks][add-custom-blocks] and include them in your application.

:::note
This document is about the newer version of Blockly Developer Tools that
is compatible with Blockly v10+. If you are looking for the legacy tool, see the
[legacy documentation][legacy-block-factory].

areas](/images/block-factory/block_factory_overview.png)

## Define a block

The Block Factory workspace will start with an empty configuration block. You
can add [inputs][inputs] and [fields][fields] to the block by dragging blocks
from the respective categories in the toolbox. You can also set the tooltip
text, help URL, colour, and connection check(s) for the block by modifying the
configuration block.

The Block Factory can only create one type of block at a time. If you want to
design several blocks that are connected together, you'll have to design the
blocks separately and connect them in the [toolbox definition][toolbox-preset].
Additionally, blocks can have advanced features like [mutators][mutators], but
these advanced features can't be created in the Factory. You'll have to modify
the block definition according to the documentation after you've built the basic
form of the block.

As you modify the configuration block in the workspace, the preview for the
block will update automatically. The code you will need to add to your
application will also update automatically.

## Output configuration

Blockly supports different methods of defining blocks and of loading Blockly
itself, as well as having multiple built-in code generator languages. The way
you define your blocks and block-code generators depends on these factors, so
you can set them in the Block Factory to change the code output.

import format, block definition format, and code generator

### Blockly import format

You can load Blockly through `<script>` tags in HTML, or using `import`
statements if you use a build tool with your application. This choice impacts
how you reference certain parts of the Blockly API. For more information on
which to choose, see the documentation about [loading Blockly][loading-blockly].
Whichever method you use, be sure to select the corresponding choice in the
Block Factory so that the code you'll add to your application is accurate for
your application.

### Block definition format

Blockly supports defining blocks in [JSON or
JavaScript][json-and-js]. The JSON format
is preferred, but if you will be adding advanced features like mutators, you can
use the JavaScript format.

### Code generator language

Blockly ships with multiple [code generator languages][code-generation]. Choose
the language(s) your application needs in order to show the corresponding
block-code generator stub. If you use a custom language generator, you can
modify the name of your custom `CodeGenerator` class after you copy the code
into your application.

## Code output

The next sections of the Block Factory show you the code you will need to copy
into your application in order to
[load the block you've created][json-and-js]. Where you copy the code will
depend on how you've structured your application, but generally you'll need to
run the code headers before the definition and block-code generator, the block
definitions before you try to use them in a toolbox, and the block-code
generators before you try to generate code for a workspace. For each of the
sections, you can use the copy button to copy the entire code block for that
section.

If you are still unsure of how to use the code output, you may be interested in
the [sample app][sample-app] which has examples of custom blocks and block-code
generators.

### Code headers

The Code Headers section shows the code you need to load the core Blockly
library and the language generator you've chosen. There may be other
configuration here too; for example, some fields you might include in a block
are from Blockly [plugins](/blockly/guides/programming/plugin_overview). These
plugins will have their own import statements and possibly other code you'll
have to run to initialize the field. This code should be included before any of
the following code sections.

### Block definition

The [block definition][block-definitions] is how you tell Blockly the shape of
your block, such as what fields and inputs it has, the colour, and more. After
you run this code, Blockly will know how to create a block just based on its
`type`.

If you are using the [sample app][sample-app], you can include this code in a
file under the `blocks/` directory. If you have your own application structure,
make sure to include this code before you try to reference a block by name, such
as in a toolbox definition. Either way, make sure the code headers are present
in the file where you include this code.

### Generator stub

The [block-code generator][block-code-generator] is how you describe the code
that should be generated for a block. The generator stub created by the Block
Factory gives you the basic code for getting the values of inputs and fields
that are on your block. It's up to you to combine these values into the final
code that will be generated!

If you are using the [sample app][sample-app], you can include this code in a
file under the `generators/` directory. If you have your own application
structure, make sure to include this code before you try to generate code for a
workspace that includes your custom blocks. Either way, make sure the code
headers are present in the file where you include this code.

### Video walkthrough

This video walks through the steps of defining a block in detail. The UI is out
date, but the block features it highlights are still more or less accurate.

## Block library

Blocks are saved in the browser's local storage automatically any time you make
a change to the block. You can create a new block or load an existing block from
your local storage by clicking the corresponding buttons in the top toolbar.

### Import from legacy Block Factory

If you've used the [legacy Block Factory][legacy-block-factory] and want to
migrate your existing block definitions into the new tool, you can do so by
following these steps:

1.  In the legacy Block Factory, click the `Export Block Library` button in the
    toolbar. This will download a file with all of your block definitions.

    ![Screenshot of the legacy Block Factory with the "Export Block Library"
    button
    highlighted](/images/block-factory/block_factory_legacy_export.png)
1.  In the new Block Factory, click the "Load block" button in the toolbar.
1.  Select the "Import from Block Factory" option in the menu.

    ![Screenshot of the Block Factory showing the "Load block" and "Import"
    buttons
    highlighted](/images/block-factory/block_factory_import.png)
1.  Upload the file you downloaded in Step 1.
1.  Your block definitions should be automatically converted to the new format
    and will now be available from the `Load block` menu. Blocks may have been
    renamed if there were conflicts with existing blocks.
1.  If there were errors parsing any of your blocks, we won't be able to load
    them. You can help us by [filing a
    bug](https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/blockly-samples/issues/new/choose) against
    blockly-samples and including the file that wouldn't parse.
